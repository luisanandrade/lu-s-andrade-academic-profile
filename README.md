*I believe in a world where technology strengthens democracy rather than threatens it.*  
My mission is to design systems, policies, and ideas that protect human rights, empower citizens, and promote global cooperation through innovation.

I use this space to trace how my work and questions evolve as I explore ways technology can empower citizens.
